## Description
<a id="description"></a>

After creating a portfolio using just HTML and CSS and then moving on as a new developer to creating a portfolio using bootstrap and a little javascript. I am now going to enhance my skills by creating a more dynamic portfolio using react.

I am going to implement the following components:

A HomePage that contains the following:

Your Name
An Image or Avatar of myself
My brand statement
Information that shows this is my portfolio site

A Projects Page to Include:

Six rendered project components that must be a reusable component that ingests JSON data as props and renders a single instance for each project.

Must utilize Router props to properly render the right project based on user selection
Must render the following info:
Project title
Link to the deployed version
Link to the GitHub repository
GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

A contact Page with the following:

Must include contact information:
Email address
Link to a PDF version of your CV
Link to your GitHub profile
Link to your LinkedIn page
Must have a contact form for handling events


Tasks and Techniques:

The rendered projects must be stored in a JSON file and imported into the project.
I need to use map to replicate the template

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
